Boston's GrownUp StoryTime is an hour of funny, heartwarming, crazy, amazing stories read aloud at Aeronaut Brewery in Somerville once a month, typically the fourth Wednesday (but check our schedule just to be sure).

Our next show is on **November 29th**. Our deadline for story submissions is always two weeks before the show date. On that note...

# Call for Writers

The next deadline for stories is **November 15th**.

Where do those stories come from? YOU!

What we need from you is your stories. Fact, fiction, and everything in between, we want them!  

Do you have a classic go-to story you tell to all your new friends?  A story that your significant other can recite verbatim?  Are you a closeted Oprah fan fiction writer? Or perhaps something you are embarrassed to tell but would make a great "Anonymous" submission...  Time to write it down and share it with a new audience.   

Stories that are chosen will be distributed among curated readers who will read them aloud at the next GrownUp StoryTime event.  See your story come to life and hear it with a new voice.

Tips to make your story stand out: 

Stories typically take from 3 to 10 minutes to read, which means max word count is about 1500 and shorter is definitely better. (7-8 stories will be read at the event so there is often only one or two longer stories per event.)  Think about your reader - punctuation and grammar should express your voice not your eight-grade English teachers or your three year old brothers.  Topics?  Anything goes.  Remember this is Grown-up story time.  We can handle anything you throw at us.

Please send stories to **BostonGUST@bootown.org** 14 days prior to the upcoming event.   

If you need a little inspiration video from our first Boston StoryTime (big thanks to SCATV for recording!):  <https://youtu.be/jmEPR88QRHI>  Jump around, there are 9 stories total.
